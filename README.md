API Design Patterns Documentation

This repository contains an API implemented using two different design patterns: Factory Method and Abstract Factory.

## Introduction

In software engineering, design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur during software development. Two such design patterns used in this API are:

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Usage

To use the API, follow the steps mentioned in the [Installation](#installation) section.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`.
4. Run the application using Spring Boot: `mvn spring-boot:run`.
5. To test the api, use this swagger link: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
